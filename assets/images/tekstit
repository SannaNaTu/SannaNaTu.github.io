Hi!I'm Sanna and I am studying to become a software developer at 
LAB University of Applied Sciences as a Bachelor of Business with 
specialization in digital operations. My goal is to graduate on December 2021. At this moment
I'm on that point of my studies that I need to find a internship place. 
And ofcourse I am looking for an summerjob too and maybe a diploma work subject too!

I'm hoping to find a place to do my internship soon so that I could start on febryary 2021.
My interest on this field are in frontend and robotics. You can reed more of my knowledge on section What I know. 

During my studies I have birth two amazing kids. That has effected on my studies quite a lot. I will be graduating 
one year later than others on my class. And also in my spare time I have done more Lego Dublo castles that coding. But it hasn't 
effected on my enthusiasm towards my new future in IT field.

We are studying under a Business program so 1/3 our studies are on that field. Such as margeting, business knowledge, 
accounting ect.

On my spare that (that little time that I have ) I've been doing some Mimmit koodaa workshops.
